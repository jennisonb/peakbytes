                  I use crystal-free diamond tip wands along with adjustable suction to remove the outermost layer of dead skin cells from the epidermis. This promotes stimulation of fibroblasts for collagen production, & provides highly effective overall rejuvenation of skin health. It is non-invasive, painless, requires no down-time, and is appropriate for most skin types. This treatment can effectively treat dry, patchy skin, fine lines & wrinkles, sun damage, hyperpigmentation and acne scarring. The Basic Microdermabrasion is a 15 min appointment time.  If you prefer a more relaxing experience with your microdermabrasion feel free to add on a mask and that will increase the appointment time to 25 to 30 min.

                <h3>Bio-Feedback Scan</h3>
                <p><strong>Service $70.00 and this includes a personalized sticker.</strong></p>
                <p>This Biofeedback scan utilizes frequencies that are input into the body and monitors the body's reaction to the frequencies. The frequencies your body reacts to are recorded and the exact frequencies are notated. Rife calls this a “hit.”  I will analyze all the hits, then select the 10 or 20 that were strongest. These frequencies will then be added to your customized sticker for you to wear on the left side of your body.</p>
                <p>A biofeedback scan now takes about 15 minutes. The appointment time is a total of 45 minutes to ensure time to imprint the proper frequencies on to your sticker. Biofeedback scans require a frequency sweep to be input to the body, plus a system to monitor the results of this. As this sweep is being transmitted, it will kill or injure pathogens. Your body registers these events as stresses, and each one is clearly recorded. Depending on your settings, it will then analyze all the hits, then select the 10 or 20 that were strongest. The frequencies which caused these are assembled into a program you can save and use to treat the problems found. The human body, it may surprise you to learn, is made up of more than 50% bacterial cells. Most of these organisms are harmless, some are beneficial, and some cause disease. The biofeedback scan is not capable of telling the difference between them – it can only report how big a stress the destruction of each caused in your body. To put it another way, it lists the organisms that “screamed loudest.”</p>
                <p>But, there's no guarantee that these are the nasty ones. In fact, serious pathogens are often able to hide from your immune system because they've developed stealth strategies. So while they may be hit and killed, their presence might not register over the “noise” of trillions of other bacteria, all of which are also being hit. Repeated scans are necessary to “clear the stage” of all the loud and melodramatic organisms first. When that's done, the Rife system can now “hear” the bad guys clearly. Biofeedback scanning is like peeling an onion, layer by layer.</p>

                <p><strong>TESTIMONIALS FOR THE RIFE TREATMENT</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>&quot;I have had hair loss for 15 years. My hair was very thin and getting hard to conceal anymore! Tracy added me to her Rife hair frequencies. I started noticing thicker hair especially in the back and sides of my hair and some on the top. My eyelashes also started getting thicker. I am happy with my results.&quot; - Joyce P.</li>
                <li>&quot;I went into the frequencies wanting longer eyelashes and to see the fullness of my hairline increase. Over the 8 week period I believe I saw more fullness and the length of my lashes increase.  I was seeing a thinning of the hairline prior and throughout the frequencies it appears my hairline has filled in and appears thicker...win win!&quot; - Angela</li>
                <li>&quot;I noticed less lash shedding giving them more opportunity to grow longer!&quot; - Debbi</li>
                <li>&quot;My experience with frequencies has been mostly positive.  Each time I've participated in the detox, I've noticed side effects like head aches or stomach aches on certain days of the detox that are cues letting me know I have things I need to detox.  Participating in the hair, lash, and brow growth frequencies, I've noticed faster growth rate with thicker hair.  Others have also noticed it on me without me taking them I'm on the frequencies, so it's confirmation to hear it from an outside source as well.&quot; - Joyce</li>
                <li>&quot;When I was sick with covid, we tried a few immune booster frequencies that I think really helped save me from long term covid side effects as opposed to my spouse who want on the frequencies. - Terra</li>
                <li>&quot;During the detox frequencies, I was fatigued and also experienced mild breakouts. I felt similar to the beginning of pregnancy - tired from my body doing some kind of "work". Once we began the hair and skin frequencies, my hair grew noticeably faster - I noticed this with my brows, but mostly my legs. My skin became noticeably more moisturized and healthy. My facial skin appeared more youthful and plump.&quot; - Erin</li>
                <li>&quot;My name is Robyn Frier, and I participated in the 11-day detox with Tracy of Aphrodite Skin Solutions January 21st through January 31st. To be perfectly honest, I was completely skeptical the detox would even work. Think about it, how could the frequencies possibly reach me when I live over 60 miles away from the machine? Not only did I feel a difference during the 11 days, I even traveled to South Dakota for 3 days during the detox. The first thing I noticed was the bloating in my stomach started to go down, it was so exciting and uplifting I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. Following the transformation of my abdomen I noticed the midday crash was disappearing. I had so much more energy, and I'm ecstatic to report my energy levels have continued to remain over the following month. Not only has my energy increased I'm also sleeping so much better at night. A couple items I could have improved upon to get the most from the experience was drinking the amount of water suggested. I tried my best, but life and work sometimes get in the way. I would highly suggest focusing on what your body is telling you throughout the process. It was mentioned I might experience flu like symptoms and I did. It was confusing and I often thought, am I actually getting sick? I do believe the toxins were releasing from my body and the results I still experience today are proof. THANKS TRACY!&quot;</li>
                <li>&quot;Thank you Tracy Starratt for introducing me to this new product! I too feel better and sleep well and have better clarity and I am losing weight! And thanks to you reminding me that I needed to drink more water my body is detoxifying even better! Thank you Tracy! 🥰&quot; - Trish Clark</li>
                <li>&quot;I had LYME Disease and was shocked at how the remote detox really worked! I recently had surgery and was having a Lyme flare-up, which feels as if I have the flu — my skin hurts and I feel like I was hit by a truck. In the past I've had to use a combination of supplements to get the detox effect this had. After the detox my flare-up dissipated and I had tons of energy. I'm also sleeping without using a sleep aid. Looking forward to seeing what else this Rife machine can do. Thanks, Tracy!&quot; -  Judy Browne</li>
                <li>&quot;I tried the 11 day detox with Tracy Starratt using RIFE, I have to admit I was skeptical. I just couldn't understand how something like this could work remotely, through the air; so honestly, I wasn't expecting anything to happen. On day two, I started feeling something right away: I started having detox symptoms: headaches, pimples, fatigue, then things began to escalate and I was having frequent bowl movements (nothing uncomfortable, everything was just working). Also, I had an appetite and was enjoying food. All the time I was in contact with Tracy and following her advice to drink tons of water. I would drink a minimum of 120 ounces a day. Near the end of the detox, during the liver cleanse segment, I vomited yellow bile, just once. Tracy asked if I wanted to stop the detox but it was obviously working and I chose to keep going. After the cleanse was finished, it took a few days to start feeling better, but when I did feel better, I felt really good. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to improve their health. I have now started the wellness portion of the program and it still amazes me that it actually works and I can feel it right away.&quot; - Shaylan Quinn.</li>

                <ol>
                <li>I sleep at night now</li>
                <li>I have more energy throughout the day and no afternoon slump.</li>
                <li>I'm more focused now and think clearer.</li>
                <li>I'm calmer</li>
                <li>Losing Inches</li>
                <li>I have a severe onion allergy that requires an EpiPen. When I go out to eat if someone orders onions next to me, I have to leave immediately and take several Benadryl to avoid having my throat close. I have been running food allergy frequencies on myself and went to Salsa on the rock last night and had people beside me and behind me order onions with no reaction.</li></ol>
                <p>I'm super excited for everything it's done for me!  Tracy Starratt</p></ul>

                <h3>Rife Foot Detox</h3>
                <p>The Foot Detox cleanse is a professional detoxification therapy that helps with total body purification and enables the body to heal itself. 
                  This foot bath relaxes, cleanses, balances and enhances the bio energy of the body. The process uses positive and negative ions to gently draw 
                  out toxins from the body.</p>
                <p>This is no regular foot detox as others that you may have seen. It is connected to a computerized program of specialized Rife Frequencies to 
                  give a much more therapeutic effect. These ions neutralize oppositely charged toxins in the cells that are normally slow to exit the body. 
                  In this way, all the body's organs can become energized and stimulated to function optimally. The body then rids itself of these toxins through 
                  its normal processes of urination, defecation, and sweating.</p>
                <p><strong>Benefits it can help improve:</strong></p>
                <ul>

                <h3>PEMF Therapy Service</h3>
                <p>PEMF means pulse electromagnetic field. When using the PEMF mat it helps by resonating with our cells to improve function, detoxification, 
                  and energy production and healing. The frequency copies the natural frequencies of the earth and it's called a Schuman resonance. The body 
                  gets what it has naturally, but at a slightly higher dose so it can restore health. It reduces inflammation and pain, giving you more energy, 
                  improved sleep, and significant pain relief. 100% safe, PEMF is proven to be one of the best modalities of treatment for pain, both local and 
                  generalized. It activates our regenerative capacity to heal and is therefore a great treatment for injuries. Diseases like arthritis, Lyme 
                  disease and fibromyalgia can be better controlled. As cellular energy increases, immune system functions are boosted. Treatment results vary 
                  and many may feel a difference after the first treatment, but it can take 5-20 treatments for more chronic conditions.</p>
                <h4>PEMF Treatmenst can Benefit the Following Conditions</h4>

                <h3>ZYTO Balance Scan</h3>
                <p>The ZYTO BioScan relies on galvanic skin response (GSR)—an established technology that measures fluctuations in electrical conductivity of the skin.
                  One familiar application of GSR is lie detector testing. Each Virtual Item represents a different physical item. Every time the software introduces a 
                  Virtual Item, a corresponding GSR reading is taken by the Hand Cradle. Each new response is measured and tracked in comparison to the GSR baseline reading.
                </p>
                <p>You can think of ZYTO scans as questionnaires to which your body's GSR data provides the answers. These scans are designed by some of the best and 
                  brightest professionals in the world for the purpose of providing the most pertinent information about your wellness. At the completion of a scan, 
                  the software's analysis is documented in the form of a report. Information gathered in this way can help you make decisions to maintain your health.</p>

                <p><img src="img/Zyto.png"/></p>
                <p>The ZYTO scan will let you know which organs need your attention and the nutritional supplements that will respond the best for you!! It also shows you 
                  which of your emotions are the highest and may need some support. ZYTO scan services can help you detect the exact issues with your body and the steps 
                  you need to take to get your health back in balance.</p>
                <p>Take the guesswork out of nutritional supplements. Using the sophisticated BioResonance testing done in the ZYTO scan it will help you know exactly what 
                  issues your body is struggling with and what nutritional supplements will respond to those needs.</p>
                <p>Depending on the type of scan you are getting it can take 20 minutes to an hour. After the scan is complete you will get an emailed report of up to 33 
                  pages with color charts and graphs outlining in detail the most important things for you to know, along with concrete suggestions and real-time steps 
                  that will bring your body back into balance.</p>
                <p>The ZYTO Hand Cradle has been cleared by the FDA for the measurement of galvanic skin response. ZYTO software has not undergone FDA review for effectiveness.</p>
                <p style="color: red; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">ZYTO technologies are not intended to be used in the diagnosis, care, treatment, mitigation,
